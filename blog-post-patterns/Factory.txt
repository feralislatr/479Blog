The Factory design pattern is used quite frequently in Javascript. 

Though we tend to create objects by using the "new" operator, objects 

can also be created with a Factory through a generic interface. This 

interface allows us to specify the type of object to be created.

In the example, the Factory creates dots, but there are three different 

types of dots to be created. Depending on their type attribute, a hero, 

foe, or food dot will be created.
